A simple portfolio website! Feel free to use and adapt any of the code, as that's what I did for some of it! Please refrain from making a copy of the site, but if there's an element you like, adapt it to fit your site!

Of course, this is open source and I cannot enforce people not making copies, but I would encourage you to make your own site (or hire me to) that is completely unique to you. Don't know how? W3Schools is a great resource, as are the Mozilla documentations.

If you like any of my work, don't hesitate to hire me, I'm sure we can agree on a fair price.

Thanks,
Michael Dors :)
