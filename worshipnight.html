    <h1>Awesome God</h1>
    <p><h3>Verse 1</h3>When He rolls up His sleeves
        <br>
        He ain't just putting on the ritz
        <br>
        (Our God is an awesome God)
        <br>
        <br>
        There's thunder in His footsteps
        <br>
        And lightning in His fists
        <br>
        (Our God is an awesome God)
        <br>
        <br>
        And the Lord wasn't joking
        <br>
        When He kicked 'em out of Eden
        <br>
        It wasn't for no reason
        <br>
        That He shed His blood
        <br>
        His return is very close
        <br>
        And so you better be believing that
        <br>
        Our God is an awesome God
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Chorus</h3>
        Our God is an awesome God
        <br>
        He reigns from heaven above
        <br>
        With wisdom, power, and love
        <br>
        Our God is an awesome God
        <br>
        <br>
        <h3>Verse 2</h3>
        And when the sky was starless
        <br>
        In the void of the night
        <br>
        (Our God is an awesome God)
        <br>
        <br>
        He spoke into the darkness
        <br>
        And created the light
        <br>
        (Our God is an awesome God)
        <br>
        <br>
        Judgment and wrath He poured out on the Sodom
        <br>
        Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
        <br>
        I hope that you have not
        <br>
        Too quickly forgotten that
        <br>
        Our God is an awesome God
        <br>

        I need you
