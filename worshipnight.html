        <p data-aos="fade-up"><h3>Verse 1</h3>When He rolls up His sleeves
            <br>He ain't just putting on the ritz
            <br>(Our God is an awesome God)
            <br>There's thunder in His footsteps
            <br>And lightning in His fists
            <br>(Our God is an awesome God)
            <br>
            <br>And the Lord wasn't joking
            <br>When He kicked 'em out of Eden
            <br>It wasn't for no reason
            <br>That He shed His blood
            <br>His return is very close
            <br>And so you better be believing that
            <br>Our God is an awesome God

            <h3>Verse 2</h3>
            And when the sky was starless
            <br>In the void of the night
            <br>(Our God is an awesome God)
            <br>
            <br>He spoke into the darkness
            <br>And created the light
            <br>(Our God is an awesome God)
            <br>
            <br>Judgment and wrath He poured out on the Sodom
            <br>Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross
            <br>I hope that you have not
            <br>Too quickly forgotten that
            <br>Our God is an awesome God
